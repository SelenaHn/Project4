# ENGO551 - Lab 4 Assignment

## Objectives
- Gain experience with Mapbox Vector Tiles and Mapbox Studio.
- Design a visually appealing map layer.
- Integrate a vector tileset to an existing GeoWeb application.

## Overview
In this project, you'll learn about mashing up a styled vector tileset hosted on Mapbox with your web mapping application developed in the previous lab. Users will be able to load and visualize a different map layer (e.g., a Mapbox style) from your Mapbox account. You will use Mapbox to design and publish the map layer. Users will also be able to toggle on and off the new layer.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The map will initially display a map layer from Mapbox, and users can toggle between this layer and the standard OpenStreetMap layer using the "Toggle Layers" button.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the map and toggle button.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the map initialization, layer toggling functionality, and legend generation.

## Dependencies
- Leaflet.js: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- Mapbox: A web mapping platform for custom map designs.
